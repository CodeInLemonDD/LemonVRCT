# LemonVRCT - VRChat Voice Translation Script

This is a lightweight (roughly) script that can quickly (roughly) translate what you say (supports multiple languages) into various languages.

## How to Use

### Deployment

**Windows** - Go to the release section, download the specified zip file and extract it, then run .exe to use it directly.

**Linux/Mac** - Requires a Python environment, clone this repository, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the repository directory, and then run `LemonVRCT.py`.

### Usage

After opening the main program, hold K to record (this can be changed), release to perform speech-to-text, semantic correction, translation, and send it to VRChat. Enter '1' in the main program to access the settings panel for language settings, model size, and AI API settings. A simple adjustment lets you enjoy the fun of chatting freely (one-sided, haha).

This is my first open-source project. I used AI during development, some parts of the code are a bit rough, so please don't blame me QwQ.
